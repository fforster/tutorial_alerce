# ALeRCE Explorer (experimental, htmx)

Re-implementation of the ALeRCE Explorer using htmx + FastAPI + Jinja2 + Tailwind,
mirroring the patterns used in the production
[`alercebroker/web-services/multisurveys-apis`](https://github.com/alercebroker/web-services/tree/main/multisurveys-apis).

See `CLAUDE.md` for the overall design, reference implementations, and the
domain-specific traps (survey abstraction, 64-bit OIDs, ZTF→nJy normalization,
GLS periodogram, FITS rendering, etc.).

## Status

Slices 1–6 plus radar, position residuals, probability, periodogram,
catsHTM crossmatch, airmass, and **cross-survey LC overlay** are live —
the in-app header now reads "ALeRCE multisurvey explorer". The detail
view renders, in parallel from a single row click: basic info, a Chart.js
light curve (flux/mag, diff/sci, apparent/absolute with Planck-2018
distance modulus, observed/dereddened with Fitzpatrick-1999 Milky-Way
extinction), science/template/difference stamps (in-browser FITS parsing
for LSST, PNG for ZTF), an Aladin Lite sky viewer with spec-z overlays
from 10 VizieR catalogs, a classifier radar, a position-residuals
scatter, and a catsHTM crossmatch panel that prefetches under the page.
LC ↔ stamps ↔ residuals selection is synced and **dispatches to the
right survey's stamp service** for cross-survey clicks.

**Cross-survey overlay.** When the LC arrives the panel cone-searches
the *other* survey at this object's RA/Dec (3″) via `/htmx/lc_xsurvey`
and overlays the matched counterpart on the same chart: LSST detections
render as filled circles, ZTF as filled squares, ZTF FP as apex-down
triangles (LSST FP stays apex-up). The legend groups by `(survey, kind)`
— headers like `LSST det:`, `LSST FP:`, `ZTF det:` toggle the whole
bucket as a unit; disabled bands dim to grey instead of strikethrough.
Visibility survives every Flux/Mag, Diff/Sci, App/Abs, Obs/Der, Fold
toggle via a `(survey, kind, label)` snapshot in `applyModes`. The
matched cross-survey OID surfaces in the basic-info panel as a clickable
link (`/?survey=<other>&oid=<other oid>`). The position-residuals
scatter, periodogram, and CSV download all derive from the live LC and
inherit the legend's visibility — toggling `LSST det:` in the LC
instantly drops every LSST point from the residuals + periodogram input
on the next compute.

**Basic-info panel.** 2-column layout, inline HMS/Deg coord toggle +
copy-icon (green ✓ feedback), Eq ↔ Gal ↔ Ecl coord-system cycler. A
bottom action row groups **Show features** (lazy-loaded modal: version/
band/filter picker + CSV download) and **Other archives**, with the
**Airmass** button on its own row. The feature-extractor version chosen
for the modal default is the same one used to fold the light curve and
to anchor parametric overlays, so the displayed `Multiband_period` and
the folding period can never disagree.

**Periodogram.** Toggles into the position-residuals slot from the LC
toolbar. Multi-band, multi-harmonic least-squares periodogram
(Schwarzenberg-Czerny 1996; same family as P4J's MHAOV on the production
pipeline): at each frequency it jointly fits an NH=4 Fourier model per
band — own constant + own a_k/b_k for k=1…4 — by weighted least squares
(in-place Cholesky on a 9×9 SPD normal-equations matrix) and sums χ²
reductions across bands. Inputs are the surveys/bands currently visible
in the LC legend; the status line lists the bands actually consumed
(e.g. `LSST: g r · ZTF: g`). Defaults to **Sci mag** input, draws a
dashed reference line at the selected period plus a dotted line at the
feature table's `Multiband_period`, and snaps clicks within 24 px of a
peak. Selecting a period folds the main LC chart in place via
`window.lcSetFoldPeriod` — no separate folded-LC canvas.

**Deferred LC sub-fetches.** The LC htmx render is **detections-only on
the synchronous path** (~2-3 s vs. ~15 s before, when the slow TNS
bridge dominated). Four deferred fragments update the chart in place as
they land: `/htmx/lc_fp` (FP + ZTF v2 mag_corr re-merge → `lcSetBundle`),
`/htmx/lc_features` (Fold + parametric overlays → `lcSetFeatures`),
`/htmx/lc_info` (ra/dec → `lcSetCoords` → ZTF DR + IRSA E(B-V)
auto-fetch), and `/htmx/lc_xsurvey` (cross-survey counterpart →
`lcSetCrossSurvey`). The status strip self-collapses once every loader
has finished, handing the row's vertical space back to the chart. The
TNS lookup runs through a deferred `/htmx/tns_lookup` fragment from the
basic-info panel; on a match it fills the basic-info TNS row and
OOB-populates the LC redshift input via a tiny inline script.

**catsHTM crossmatch panel** prefetches on detail-view load (`hx-trigger=
"load"` instead of on-expand) so opening the collapsible is instant.
**Airmass panel** shares a grid cell with periodogram and position
residuals; mutually exclusive toggles. **Name resolver** is still deferred.
